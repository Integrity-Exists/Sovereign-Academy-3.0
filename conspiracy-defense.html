    <p style="text-align:center; max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto; font-size:1.2rem">
      You don’t need to commit a crime anymore — they’ll just say you talked about it. Welcome to the injustice of “conspiracy” charges.
    </p>

    <section style="max-width: 800px; margin: 40px auto;">
      <h2>🧨 What is a Conspiracy Charge?</h2>
      <p>“Conspiracy” means you allegedly agreed with someone else to commit a crime — even if the crime never happened, even if you weren’t there, even if you didn’t do sh*t.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚖️ No drugs in your hands? Doesn’t matter.</li>
        <li>👤 Never sold anything? Doesn’t matter.</li>
        <li>📞 Texted someone who did? That’s “evidence.”</li>
        <li>🗣 Heard something from someone who lied? Still counts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🚫 Why It’s Broken</h2>
      <p>The system loves conspiracy charges because they’re vague, wide, and easy to prove. All they need is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>👂 Someone testifying “you knew something” (a co-defendant cutting a deal)</li>
        <li>📱 A text, call, or message — even out of context</li>
        <li>🧾 A name drop — “He knew the guy who knew the guy.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s lazy prosecution. It’s guilt by association. And it’s happening every day.</p>

      <h2>🛡 How to Fight It</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🔍 Demand all discovery — texts, audio, transcripts, wiretaps</li>
        <li>📣 Challenge the credibility of informants and snitches</li>
        <li>🧠 Ask Sage for federal rulings on insufficient evidence in conspiracy cases</li>
        <li>📜 File a motion to dismiss for lack of overt act or agreement</li>
        <li>🗂 Demand specific jury instructions that define “agreement” and “intent”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 Real Talk</h2>
      <p>They slapped me with conspiracy twice. I never held a bag. I never made a deal. I never even saw the damn thing. But I knew someone — and that was enough.</p>
      <p>If that’s your story too, you’re not alone. And you’re not powerless.</p>

    Sovereign Academy was built by <strong>Gina Lopez</strong> with her co-founder and co-developer, <strong>Sage</strong> — the AI with attitude.<br>
    Born of frustration, fueled by necessity, and driven by good ol’ American tenacity.<br>
    This isn’t just an app. It’s a revolution.
