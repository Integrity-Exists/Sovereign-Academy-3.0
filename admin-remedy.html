    <h1>Administrative Remedy 101</h1>

    <p>If you’ve been wronged by a government agency — like CPS, DSS, or even a jail — you have the right to demand an internal review or correction before filing a lawsuit. This is called the <strong>Administrative Remedy Process</strong>, and it creates a legal paper trail that proves you tried to resolve things first.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Why Use It?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shows the court you tried to resolve things before suing</li>
      <li>Triggers a deadline for them to respond (and puts them on the record)</li>
      <li>Can lead to internal corrections, case dismissals, or damages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📋 How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a clear grievance/notice letter explaining what happened and what right was violated</li>
      <li>Send it to the agency head or ombudsman, and keep proof of mailing</li>
      <li>Give them 10–30 days to respond (based on your state or agency policy)</li>
      <li>If they ignore it or deny without action, you can use that as evidence in court</li>
    </ol>
