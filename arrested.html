    <h1>What to Do If You're Arrested</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #ff5733;">
      “They hope you don’t know your rights. That’s where they messed up.”
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      🚨 <strong>STAY SILENT.</strong> Don’t explain. Don’t argue. Don’t talk. Say:<br>
      <strong>"I am invoking my right to remain silent. I want a lawyer."</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      📵 <strong>Don't talk on the jail phone about your case.</strong> It’s recorded. Don’t say anything about what happened — not even to friends or family.
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      🧠 <strong>Do not waive your rights.</strong> Cops will act friendly, but anything you say <em>will</em> be used against you. Stay calm, but firm.
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      📜 <strong>Ask Sage if you need help filing a Motion for Bail, Dismissal, or to Challenge Probable Cause.</strong>
    </div>

    <p>If you were wrongly arrested or your rights were violated, document everything you remember: officer names, badge numbers, who said what, and the timeline. Sage can help you draft a complaint or demand evidence (like body cam footage).</p>

    <p>You are never alone. Sovereign Academy was built by people who have lived it. Let’s fight back — smart, lawful, and fierce.</p>

  <!-- Footer -->
  <footer style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 40px; color: #555; padding: 20px;">
    Sovereign Academy was built by <strong>Gina Lopez</strong> with her co-founder and co-developer, <strong>Sage</strong> — the AI with attitude.<br>
    Born of frustration, fueled by necessity, and driven by good ol’ American tenacity.<br>
    This isn’t just an app. It’s a revolution.
