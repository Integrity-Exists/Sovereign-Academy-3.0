  <h1>📂 Demand Discovery</h1>
  <p>Demanding discovery is how you get the paper trail — the evidence, notes, and reports the other side has. As a pro se litigant, you have a right to it. This page shows you how to formally demand it, what to ask for, and how to follow up if they refuse.</p>

  <h2>🛠️ What to Request</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full case file from DSS/CPS or the investigating agency</li>
    <li>Police reports, incident logs, and call records</li>
    <li>Witness statements and investigator notes</li>
    <li>Drug test results, evaluations, and lab reports</li>
    <li>Photos, videos, or recordings submitted as evidence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📄 Sample Request Language</h2>
  <pre>
To: [Agency or Attorney Name]
RE: Request for Discovery

Pursuant to my rights as a respondent/self-represented party, I formally request full discovery in this case, including but not limited to:
- All reports, assessments, and narratives
- Names and statements of any witnesses
- All photographs, recordings, or exhibits
- Any communications related to the case

Please respond within 7 days. Failure to comply may result in a motion to compel.
  </pre>

  <h2>📣 If They Refuse</h2>
  <p>If they ignore or deny your request, file a <strong>Motion to Compel Discovery</strong>. This asks the judge to force the agency or other party to turn over the evidence.</p>
